# jd-prjdoc -- LaTeX document class for project documentation

This package implements a *LaTeX document class* to write manuals, requirement
specification or other ISO9001 aware documents. The package comes with some
additional styles for environments to define test cases and commands
descriptions.

I've written these styles as part of an ISO9001 project documentation in 1999.
After reactivating this class as base of an pandoc template, I decided to make
it public.

I'm not a LaTeX developer, so don't expect to much. ;-)
